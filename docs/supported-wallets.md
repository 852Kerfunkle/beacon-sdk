# Supported Wallets

You can try out the alpha version of [AirGap Wallet](https://github.com/airgap-it/airgap-wallet/releases/tag/v3.0.3) on Android. If you would like to have access to the iOS test version, please reach out to us.

Otherwise, you can use the [Beacon Extension](https://github.com/airgap-it/beacon-extension/releases).

## What is Beacon?

Beacon connects DApps on Tezos directly to your mobile and desktop wallet through a decentralized peer-to-peer network.
