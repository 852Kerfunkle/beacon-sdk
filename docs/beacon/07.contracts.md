# Interacting with Contracts

The `beacon-sdk` does not provide any abstractions for contracts. The focus of beacon is handling the connection between DApps and wallets and providing a user friendly API to interact with each other.

[Taquito](https://tezostaquito.io/) is a popular library for development on the Tezos blockchain. They are currently working on a new [Wallet API](https://github.com/ecadlabs/taquito/pull/308) that connects the power of Taquito's contract abstraction with Beacon's communication layer.

The Wallet API has only recently been merged into the master branch of Taquito, so make sure you have a recent version:

```
npm i @taquito/taquito@6.3.0-beta.5
npm i @taquito/beacon-wallet@6.3.0-beta.5
```

As of the time of writing, `6.3.0-beta.5` is the most recent version.

There is currently no documentation available for the Wallet API. There is a community driven document outlining some of the changes between the Contract API and Wallet API [here](https://hackmd.io/Ns6ZpuY6TLSNKDv1Wr9fvA)

The following is a small example of a contract call in Taquito, loosely based on our [Example DApp](https://github.com/airgap-it/beacon-vue-example/blob/master/src/components/Beacon.vue#L122)
